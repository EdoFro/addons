Freeplane add-ons
=================

Add-ons extend Freeplane features and/or look. Not all existing
add-ons are hosted in this repository. There are other,
user-contributed add-ons living in other repositories at Github and
Bitbucket. You just should make sure:

*    that your add-on is under version control, preferably publicly
     available.
*    that your add-ons is listed on the [add-on wiki page](http://freeplane.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Add-ons)

Learn how to write your own add-ons from the [add-on howto](http://freeplane.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Add-on_Howto).
